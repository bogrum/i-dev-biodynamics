## Bio

I am a dedicated researcher and **Bioinformatics Master's student** at Gebze Technical University, with a strong background in **Bioengineering**. My work focuses on the intersection of biological systems and computational tools, particularly in **structural bioinformatics**, **molecular simulations**, and **protein-ligand interactions**.

Currently, I serve as the **President for ISCB-SC RSG-Turkey**, where I contribute to the growth and organization of the computational biology community in Turkey.

## Education

* **M.Sc. in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology** | Gebze Technical University | 2025 – Present
* **B.Sc. in Bioengineering** | Gebze Technical University | 2019 – 2025

## Research & Projects

I have actively contributed to several national research initiatives supported by **TÜBİTAK**:

* **TÜBİTAK 2209-A:** Developing a web-based tool for screening small binding pockets in protein ensembles and conducting ensemble docking simulations.
* **TÜBİTAK 3501:** Investigating H2 production mechanisms of water reduction catalysts using Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), Density Functional Theory (DFT), and Free Energy Perturbation theory.
* **Bioinformatics Tool Development:** Experienced in scraping database data to generate paired protein-ligand lists and developing front-end components for bioinformatics applications.

## Technical Skills

* **Simulations & Modeling:** GROMACS, AutoDock Vina, Smina, PyMOL, VMD.
* **Programming:** Python (Intermediate), Bash/Shell scripting, and Web Development (HTML/CSS/JS).
* **Dry Lab:** RASPA Molecular Simulations, Monte Carlo simulations, and Molecular Docking.
* **Other Tools:** CAD Software (SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Fusion360), Adobe Photoshop, and Linux System Administration.

Beyond the laboratory, I am an enthusiast of the "Maker" culture. I have previously served as an instructor for middle school students, teaching CAD sketching and 3D modeling for DIY projects.
